1.  No user details need to chat
2.  No need to provide email & phone 
3.  Data can be deleted by user
4.  Application must be lightweight 
5.  Multiple users can chat


### OVERVIEW :

The anonymous chat room project is a real-time chat application that provides users to chat with each other. It uses React and Node.js to provide a fast and efficient chat experience and Socket.IO for real-time communication between users. MongoDB is used to store chat messages and user data. And user can delete their data if they want.

### HOW TO USE :

```
cd server
npm install

### Extra Informations :

<p>
The anonymous chat room project is a real-time chat application that provides an anonymous chat room for users to chat with each other. The project is built using React, Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.
<br><br>
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a fast and efficient way to build complex and interactive UI components. Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that provides a fast and scalable way to build web applications.
<br><br>
Socket.IO is a library for building real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. It enables real-time communication between the chat room participants, allowing for a seamless chat experience. MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easy to store and retrieve data for web applications.
<br><br>
The anonymous chat room project provides an anonymous chat room where users can chat with each other in real-time. Users can join the chat room by entering a unique username, and they can start chatting with other users in the chat room.
<br><br>
The project uses Socket.IO to handle real-time communication between the client and server. Messages are sent and received in real-time, enabling a seamless chat experience for the users. MongoDB is used to store chat messages and user data, making it easy to retrieve and display chat history.
